In brain mapping, ViTs assist in identifying abnormalities like\nlesions or aneurysms, contributing to more accurate treatment planning.Their role in organ\nsegmentation has streamlined pre-surgical planning, enabling precise visualization of\nanatomical structures. ViTs have also been instrumental in research areas such as studying\ngenetic disorders,where subtlephenotypicvariationscan belinked tounderlyingconditions.\nThe integration of ViTsinmedical imagingworkflows hasnot onlyenhanceddiagnostic\nprecision but also reduced the workload of radiologists and pathologists. However, challenges\nremain, such as ensuring model interpretability and addressing ethical concerns related to data\nprivacy and bias. As these issues are resolved, ViTs are poised to become an integral part of\nmodernhealthcare.\nKESHAVMEMORIALINSTITUTEOFTECHNOLOGY PAGENO.15", "KESHAV MEMORIAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\n(An Autonomous Institute)\n(Accredited by NBA & NAAC, Approved By A.I.C.T.E., Reg\nby Govt ofTelangana State &Affiliated to JNTU,Hyderabad)\nCERTIFICATE\nThis is to certify that seminar work entitled \u201cVISION TRANSFORMERS\u201d is a bonafide\nwork carried out in the seventh semester by \u201cDULAM SATYA VAMSI KRISHNA Roll No.\n21BD1A660N\u201d in partial fulfillment for the award of Bachelor of Technology in \u201cCOMPUTER\nSCIENCE & ENGINEERING-CSE(AI&ML)\u201d from JNTU Hyderabad during theacademic year\n2024- 2025 and nopartofthis workhas beensubmitted earlierfor the awardof anydegree.\nTECHNICALSEMINARINCHARGE HEADOFTHEDEPARTMENT", "KESHAV MEMORIAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\n(An Autonomous Institute)\n(Accredited by NBA & NAAC, Approved By A.I.C.T.E., Reg\nby Govt ofTelangana State &Affiliated to JNTU,Hyderabad)\nListOf Figures PageNo.\nFigure1.2Transformer Architecture 2\nFigure1.3Image Classification 3\nFigure1.3Object Detection 3\nFigure2.2Self Attention 6\nKESHAVMEMORIALINSTITUTEOFTECHNOLOGY PAGENOI"]}
